module RandomWords
  # This class extends the Integer class with methods to convert numbers
  # into their word representations. It provides methods for converting
  # numbers to words in various languages, including English.
  #
  # @example
  #   1.to_word # => "one"
  #   126620.to_word # => "one hundred twenty six thousand six hundred twenty"
  #
  class ::Integer
    # Turn a number into the word representation of that number.
    #  1.to_word      # => "one"
    #  126620.to_word # => "one hundred twenty six thousand six hundred twenty"
