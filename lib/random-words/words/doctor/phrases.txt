a blessing in disguise
bite the bullet
break the ice
burning the midnight oil
caught between a rock and a hard place
cutting corners
every cloud has a silver lining
hit the nail on the head
in the heat of the moment
jumping on the bandwagon
keep your chin up
let the cat out of the bag
on cloud nine
out of the blue
piece of cake
pulling someone's leg
see eye to eye
sitting on the fence
spill the beans
the ball is in your court
the best of both worlds
the early bird catches the worm
through thick and thin
turn a blind eye
under the weather
walking on eggshells
when pigs fly
you can't judge a book by its cover
your guess is as good as mine
