I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell
I'm not saying I'm not a little crazy
you know, I could have been a contender
I can’t help but feel that you’re trying to take advantage of me
There’s a lot of people who think I’m crazy
I’m a little bit of a loner
you’re not going to believe this
I’m just a guy who’s trying to make a living
I’ve got a problem with authority
The man who doesn’t believe in the future is a man without hope
I have a plan
you’re going to make me cry
I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed
I’m not a monster
you can’t handle the truth
I don’t care what you think
you can’t put a price on a good time
I’m in the mood for a little chaos
I’m not going to let you down
you’re just a little too late
I love the smell of napalm in the morning
What’s the matter with you
I’m going to make you an offer you can’t refuse
you’ve got a big mouth
it’s all about the journey
you’re going to regret this
I’m a lover, not a fighter
I’m not afraid; I’m just cautious
I’m going to make this happen
you’re barking up the wrong tree
you’re a fragile little thing
I’m going to show you something
I’m not here to make friends
I’m very good at what I do
I’ll see you in another life
I’m not afraid of you
you think you know me
you’re just a pawn in my game
you have no idea what I’m capable of
you’re not as clever as you think
I’m going to make this right
you think you know everything
I’m going to take you down
you’re going to regret this decision
I’m not going anywhere
