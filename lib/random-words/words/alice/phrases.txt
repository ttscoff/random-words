curiouser and curiouser
it’s no use going back to yesterday
we're all mad here
why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast
off with their heads!
you’re entirely bonkers
it’s a rabbit hole, of course
I can’t go back to yesterday because I was a different person then
would you like an adventure now, or shall we have our tea first?
the hurrier I go, the behinder I get
I've had enough nonsense
I'll try to be nicer if you'll try to be smarter
we're all just a little mad
I’m late, I’m late, for a very important date
take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves
the best way to explain it is to do it
