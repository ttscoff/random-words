don't be such a lazy ass and get moving
get your shit together before i lose it
i can't believe you did that you crazy bastard
i can't even with you right now
i swear to god this is ridiculous
i wouldn't trust you to babysit a goldfish
I'd agree with you but then we'd both be wrong
I'd call you a clown but that's an insult to clowns
I'd call you a tool but that implies you're actually useful
I'd explain it to you but I'm out of puppets
I'd love to see you try to dig your way out of this one
I'd say you're full of surprises but I'd be lying
I'm not arguing I'm just explaining why you're wrong
I'm not saying you're stupid but you have bad luck with brains
if brains were dynamite you wouldn't have enough to blow your nose
if ignorance is bliss you must be the happiest person alive
if only common sense were a superpower
if you were any more dense you'd be a black hole
it's like talking to a brick wall with you
stop acting like a spoiled brat and grow up
stop being a drama queen for once
that idea is as dumb as a bag of rocks
that's a real slap in the face you know
that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard you genius
that's the worst excuse i've ever heard
this is a circus and you're the main attraction
this is a complete clusterfuck of a situation
this is a complete shitshow and you know it
this is a disaster wrapped in a catastrophe
this is a perfect example of how not to do it
this is a total trainwreck of a plan
this is just a shit show waiting to happen
this is the funniest shit i've ever seen
what the hell is wrong with you
who the hell do you think you are
you couldn't pour water out of a boot if the instructions were on the heel
you dance like nobody's watching and i wish they weren't
you have the charm of a brick
you have the charm of a wet mop
you have the social skills of a rock
you're a few cards short of a full deck
you're a few fries short of a happy meal
you're a legend in your own mind my friend
you're a real gem just not the shiny kind
you're a real piece of work aren't you
you're a real piece of work aren't you
you're a shining example of how not to live life
you're about as bright as a black hole
you're about as exciting as watching paint dry
you're about as sharp as a marble
you're about as useful as a chocolate teapot
you're as popular as a skunk at a barbecue
you're as useless as a screen door on a submarine
you're as welcome as a skunk at a lawn party
you're driving me up the wall you idiot
you're full of shit but i love it
you're like a broken pencil pointless
you're like a cloud when you disappear it's a beautiful day
you're like a human version of a participation trophy
you're like a software bug that never gets fixed
you're like a software update nobody wants to deal with
you're like a tornado full of bad ideas
you're not the brightest crayon in the box
you're not the worst but you definitely make the list
you're one sandwich short of a picnic
you're the king of bad decisions my dude
you're the poster child for why some animals eat their young
you're the reason god created the middle finger
you're the reason the gene pool needs a lifeguard
you're the reason we can't have nice things
you've got the grace of a bull in a china shop
you've got the personality of a damp rag
your face would make a train take a dirt road
your sense of humor is like a black hole
