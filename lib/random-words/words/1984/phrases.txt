big brother is watching you
war is peace
freedom is slavery
ignorance is strength
I love big brother
the past was dead, the future was unimaginable
thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death
who controls the past controls the future
the Ministry of Truth is responsible for news
reality exists in the human mind
the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
if you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself
the lie becomes truth
it was a bright cold day in April
doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs
you are not allowed to think for yourself
